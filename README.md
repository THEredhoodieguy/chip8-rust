# chip8-rust
A Chip8 emulator written in Rust

Built following along with Alex Ene's build at https://github.com/AlexEne/rust-chip8

I'm undertaking this project to learn how to better write Rust and how to write an emulator.

Using Cowgod's Chip8 technical reference at http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM
